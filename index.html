                Members of the tripartite core group, including EU officials, are reportedly in talks
                over establishing the governing authority to run this socially oriented initiative.

                Tensions between EU countries and Russia have tended to increase over the last months amid Russia's
                military aggression against Ukraine and inevitable sanctions employed. Needless to say, both sides have
                never been on the same page. Therefore, the current state of affairs will likely result in a deepening
                crisis of general decline. It mainly refers to gas blackmail following Nord Stream 2 collapse, an energy
                embargo, and another sanction package initiated by EU authorities. They are backed by NATO and USA.
              </p>

              <div class="article__paragraph">
                Such a course of action has proved effective in cleaning up the mess created by Moscow's shortfall
                policy. As detailed by numerous reports inside European Union, passing a resolution on the issue is on
                the cards, meaning economic sentiment decline and further weakening of Russia's economy. Various experts
                claim that turning to corrupted officials and European outcasts to slow things down does not work the
                way it should.

                as quoted by a former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It was all about the Soviet Union during the
                Cold War. Nevertheless, things will always be the same when it comes to modern Russia and its

                affects ordinary Europeans. They now face numerous challenges, from higher bills to increasing

                Fortunately, the Kremlin has failed to succeed as turning to alternative energy suppliers is already on
